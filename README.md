# Computer Vision RPS
## Project Overview

This project will build an implementation of an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game, in which a player can use the computer camera to play!

The code for implementing this game relies on an import from the random function to select a random choice of rock, paper, or scissors for the computer 'player' ('CPU', according to my mario-kart knowledge). A separate function allows for simple user input and storage of said input as a choice in the game. Finally, a get_winner function compares the computer and user choices, utilising some classic if/elif/else statements to compute the winner. The 'play' function then combines all these into a simple function call for initialising and running a game.
